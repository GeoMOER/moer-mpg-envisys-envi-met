## Goals 

After the first attempts - specifically after the technical example simulations, a first review of the available literature as well as a rough structuring of the research questions, it is now necessary to design a concrete approach.

## Assignment
Design a concrete problem and a suitable associated modeling concept to assess the performance of Envimet to simulate essential microclimatic parameters in forest stands.  Consider the following aspects:
* abiotic endowment of the model domain (relief, soil, site location).
* biotic features of the model domain (simple/3D vegetation)
* technical model domain (x,y,z extent, time steps nesting)
* appropriate meteorology for model initialization (ideal, real values)
* Validation strategy


* Work packages - What is to be done when and by whom?
 * WP 1 technical and abiotic modell
 * WP 2 meteo data initialization
 * WP 3 Vegetation "simple
 * WP 4 Vegetation "3D
 * WP 5 Validation strategy



The task is then as follows:

The resulting concept should be prepared as a table (similar to the below example), also addressing the literature/data  used as well as know shortcomings.

| Workpackage 1 ||||
| item | solution | references | ressources needed |
|:-------:|:--------|:---------|:---------|
| relief | build-in version xy | online access | ? |
| soil properties | soil data MOF | access has to be clarified |  who knows|
| soil vertical structure | four levels temperature soil moisture build-in model| envi-met | ? |
|... |... |... |... |
