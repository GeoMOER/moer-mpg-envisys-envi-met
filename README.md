# Goals
This course introduces you to user-oriented physical microlimate modeling. You will learn to model realistic 3D real-world structures and generate robust microclimatological datasets using ENVI-met software. The highly parametric, user-supportive interfaces allow models to be generated with comparatively little effort. Their simulations provide insight into the high-resolution 3D structure of the model domains. 

The main purpose of modeling is to (1) develop our understanding of complex 4D processes. (2) To conduct a realistic project study based on real MEteo and geospatial data.  During the course, you will use various scenarios so that you can make appropriate choices for your own project.

Assignments will give you hands-on experience Developing, fitting, and applying computer simulation models.

The course thus provides an introduction to physical modeling. It teaches the use of modern modeling software and the basic understanding of physical process flows.
