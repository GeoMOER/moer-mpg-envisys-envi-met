* [Course Data Server](){:target="_blank"} data from the course data server.

## Specific Software 

Please finde all Downloads according to Env_Met at the [Envi-Met Lnding Page](https://envi-met.info/doku.php?id=start)

## Common Software 

Shell â€” any command line environment will do for most of the exercises. For Linux we recommend the [bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) shell. For Windows, although the Windows command line can be used, we strongly recommend the shell coming with the [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w) installation. If you want a Linux flavored shell in Windows, you can also use the one that comes with the [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installation which you would need for Git anyway.

* [QGIS](HTTP://www.qgis.org/de/docs/user_manual/index.html#qgis-manual-index-reference) has become one of the most promising and most integrative open source GIS systems over the last years. Through the processing plugin, it additionally integrates modules from the other leading free GIS solutions like 

Regarding installation, for Ubuntu Linux, the [Ubuntu GIS package](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGIS) is a good choice. For Windows, we strongly recommend installing everything via the [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) environment and not the standalone QGIS installation tool. 

We will use the statistical scripting language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and we highly recommend the  [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) integrated developing environment. 

Please follow the instructions according to your operating system.
