ENVI-met V4 is a three-dimensional, non-hydrostatic model for simulating surface-plant-air interactions, It is designed for the microscale with a typical horizontal resolution of 0.5 to 10 m and a typical time frame of 24 to 48 hours with a time step of 1 to 5 seconds. This resolution allows for the analysis of small-scale interactions between individual buildings, surfaces, and plants

## Goals

This task involves three sub-areas:

1. to get a first overview about non-hydrostatic 4D climate modeling.
2. to get a first insight into the application areas of such simulations.
3. to install the software and perform a first simple tutorial simulation

## Things you need 

{% include gallery id="panel1" layout="third" caption="[Course Data Server](https://137.248.191.215:8989/sharing/SxrDkOsBp) Data folder for any file exchange and data related purposes." %} 

ENVI-met software at the [ENVI-met landing page](https://envi-met.info/doku.php?id=start)



## Assignment
The studies are intended to provide a first overview of the possibilities of the application. It is a first overview about the subject 

The tutorials are a selection from the Envimet download area. In particular session_1_apps.pdf and session_1_concepts.pdf are a compilation of the concepts of Envimet and the individual components for the workflow with the individual modules, respectively, created by me. You will also find the links to the Youtube channel if you prefer videos.

These two compilations from the Envimet help pages should be sufficient to perform the example modeling "Precipitation".

In the folder Literature you will find chapter1.pdf and chapter3.pdf. Both are reasonably understandable basics for climate modeling from a Belgian textbook. In case of more detailed questions they are worth a look.


The task is then as follows:

    * Installation of ENVI-met on your computer
    *  Read session_1_conpepts.pdf for a first introduction to the ENVI-met model concepts (chapter3.pdf could also be helpful here for supplementation and deepening)
    => If available, articulate questions problems

    * Read session_1_apps.pdf as a basis for the example modeling "Precipitation".
     => If available, articulate questions, problems, etc. 
    * Run the precipitation simulation (check if it runs)
     => If available, articulate questions, problems etc.

    Cross-reading of min 2 publications (What is the basic idea)
    => Prepare a short summary

Any written notes please put them on [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/wTdarJkV/256c20df677f25924b21e86003d2edf1/umwelstsysteme-envi-met) in the board for this course. 

Please note: For Trello you need to register.
{: .notice--warning}

In Trello you will find the assignments again as a checklist and also empty lists where you can/should write cards with your questions or article summaries. So you can also read the papers without overlap and possibly answer each other in between time.
