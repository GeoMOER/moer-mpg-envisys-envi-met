## General Information
Forest ecosystems have highly variable microclimates that are also significantly different from the surrounding climate. In the forest, direct solar radiation and wind speed are greatly reduced leading to the attenuation of extreme climates. The magnitude and more so the processes of these differences especially in a highly structured and relief forest is significant. This course will attempt to predict the spatiotemporal high-resolution heterogeneity of microclimates using the modeling software Envi_Met. 

## Requirements
* Admission
* Internet access
* Prior knowledge of computer modeling or programming is helpful.
* Prior knowledge of physics is helpful

## Course Objectives

This course introduces you to user-oriented physical microlimate modeling. You will learn to model realistic 3D real-world structures and generate robust microclimatological datasets using Envi_Met software. The highly parametric, user-supportive interfaces allow models to be generated with comparatively little effort. Their simulations provide insight into the high-resolution 3D structure of the model domains. 

The main purpose of modeling is to (1) develop our understanding of complex 4D processes. (2) To conduct a realistic project study based on real MEteo and geospatial data.  During the course, you will use various scenarios so that you can make appropriate choices for your own project.

Assignments will give you hands-on experience Developing, fitting, and applying computer simulation models.

The course thus provides an introduction to physical modeling. It teaches the use of modern modeling software and the basic understanding of physical process flows.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
* understand a complex tool sufficiently to use it to model basic systems. 
* Conduct, evaluate, and present a case study.

# Course Features
The course is designed as a face-to-face course with self-study.

Information due to **Coronavirus Pandemic**: For infection control reasons, physical face-to-face events are not possible at this time. Therefore, the course will be held in digital presence. 

## Course Materials

Basic Literature:


In addition, there is additional reading under the assignments. The articles, tutorials and studies linked there are available online (students account) or posted on Ilias.


## Modeling Software
This course uses specific modeling software. There are numerous software packages available for simulating weather, climate, and microclimate. Most are extremely complex and require rlonger training.

We use [Envi_Met](https://envi_met.com/) by [Michael Bruse](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bruse) in the course. Envi_Met is a powerful GUI-based microclimate model that specializes in urban climates.  You will need a Windows PC and a license key to use it, which is available from the course instructor . 


## Time expenditure and expiration

In an average work week, you should spend 10-12 hours on the course. The breakdown is roughly as follows:

* Digital presence: 2 hours per week.
  * Course meets 1 time per week as a 90 minute session - attendance is required for comprehension.
  * Optional review tutorial to answer questions - voluntary participation.
* Study outside of attendance: 8-10 hours per week.
  * Weekly reading to prepare for the face-to-face session
  * Weekly hands-on modeling 
  * Weekly completion of assignments.
  
* To prepare for attendance, tutorial please email questions to the course instructor with subject: [envi_met]. 
* The presence time serves (1) a compact introduction to the respective topic and (2) the discussion of the questions that arise to the input units in the form of screencasts, videos and readers as well as exercises. If it is technically not possible to hold the classroom session, a screencast with the answers to the questions will be posted online.
* A total of four assignments are to be completed as coursework.
* As examination performance, a small study is to be carried out as a project. The project report will be assessed on the basis of the model created. More detailed information about the projects, the type of report and the assessment criteria will be made available on 01.05.2021. The assessment performance is to be done individually/in tandem.
* The evaluation guide will be posted by 05/01/2021.
* Submission of the project: 15.09..2021 (00 o'clock).
